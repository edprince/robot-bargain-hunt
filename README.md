Repository containing all collaborative work for the robot-bargain-hunt project

If anybody is interested, I'm experimenting with a web app called 'Trello' which
helps manage projects using lists and stuff. Might be worth exploring, but could
be a dead end. https://trello.com/b/fjeu9Pvw/robot-bargain-hunt


#Ideas#
These are just a bunch of totally random ideas for possibilities for our game.
 - Alien planet game finding creatures/samples etc.
 - Archeology game finding artifacts in a dig site.
 - Zombie epidemic (infected people being sorted and searched based on their
   level of infection)
 - Shopping spree
 - Thief stealing items from a house, steal as much as possible before alarm
   goes off.
