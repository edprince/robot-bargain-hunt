Repository containing all collaborative work for the robot-bargain-hunt project

If anybody is interested, I'm experimenting with a web app called 'Trello' which
helps manage projects using lists and stuff. Might be worth exploring, but could
be a dead end. https://trello.com/b/fjeu9Pvw/robot-bargain-hunt

##The Game##
This project sees a robot search a randomly generated map for different artifcats, each with a different value. The robot searches for the items in order. The order is either ascending in value, or descending in value.

Then the robot sets off and proceeds to collect each item, with the collected items displaying in the robots inventory.

##Ideas##
These are just a bunch of totally random ideas for possibilities for our game.
 - Alien planet game finding creatures/samples etc.
 - Archeology game finding artifacts in a dig site.
 - Zombie epidemic (infected people being sorted and searched based on their
   level of infection)
 - Shopping spree
 - Thief stealing items from a house, steal as much as possible before alarm
   goes off.
 - Easter egg hunt - Each egg has its own value, need to collect as many as 
   you can in a given time.
 - Beach search - Finding rubbish on the beach and sorting them in the 
   increasing value.
